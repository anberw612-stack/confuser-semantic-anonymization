# confuser-semantic-anonymization
Semantic anonymization system for cross-user dialogue matching
Concept Author: Anonymous
First Disclosed: November 19, 2025

I. Problem Statement
Large language models accumulate millions of user queries daily. A significant portion of these queries are semantically similar—different people asking nearly identical questions, often unaware that their "unique" problem has been encountered and solved by others.
Current systems waste this overlap. They answer each query in isolation, discarding potential knowledge reuse and human connection.

II. System Architecture
I propose a three-layer system:
Layer 1: Semantic Matching Engine
Embed incoming queries into a semantic space
Identify historical queries with cosine similarity >0.85
Rank by semantic proximity and response quality
Layer 2: Confuser Module
Before presenting matched dialogues to users, apply semantic-preserving obfuscation:
What Confuser Does:
Detects identity markers: pronouns, timestamps, locations, professional roles
Replaces with contextually plausible alternatives (not deletion, not redaction—substitution with maintained coherence)
Preserves core semantic structure and information density

Example transformation:
Original: "I'm a 28-year-old software engineer in Seattle, struggling with..."
Confused: "A professional in the tech industry recently faced..."
Critical distinction: Unlike PII anonymization (which removes), Confuser rewrites to maintain readability while severing identity linkage. The AI can still reason about the semantic core, but cannot reconstruct the author.
Layer 3: User Bridging
When two users have posed sufficiently similar questions:

Show each user the Confused version of the other's query
Offer AI-synthesized answer combining both historical responses
If both opt-in, establish anonymized peer connection under AI moderation

III. Novel Contributions
1. Semantic-level anonymization (vs. entity-level masking)
Existing tools (Presidio, HaS framework) remove PII. Confuser restructures style and context to break authorship attribution while preserving semantic utility.
2. Bidirectional user matching in knowledge domains
Existing peer-matching systems (Supportiv, Peerakeet) focus on emotional support. This system targets intellectual resonance—connecting people through shared questions, not shared feelings.
3. AI as mediator, not just responder
The system doesn't just answer questions. It identifies human-human connection opportunities and manages the privacy-utility tradeoff in real-time.
IV. Technical Challenges Acknowledged

Confuser robustness: Must resist adversarial de-anonymization attempts
False positive matching: Over-eager matching degrades user trust
Cultural/linguistic adaptation: Anonymization strategies must vary by language

V. Prior Art Analysis
I have reviewed:

OKI Corporation patent (2008): Basic chatbot-based interest matching
IBM authorship anonymization patent (US10360407B2): Style obfuscation
Recent academic work: HaS framework, ALISON, LOPSIDED

Key differentiation: No existing system combines semantic question-matching, bidirectional user connection, and real-time dialogue obfuscation in a unified architecture for general knowledge exchange.
VI. Intended Outcomes
If implemented:

Reduce redundant AI responses by surfacing existing solutions
Enable organic knowledge-sharing networks without identity exposure
Create "intellectual matchmaking" substrate for collaboration

This is not a proposal seeking collaborators.
